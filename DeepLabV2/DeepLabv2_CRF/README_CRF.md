## About DeepLabv2_ResNet101_CRF.py  
  
# This Version of DeepLabv2 is implemented with CRF(Conditional Random Fields) as post-processing  
# However, the CRF works but is not tested due to its high computational cost and our limited resources  
# Further tuning is required to obtain an actual advantage from this method
